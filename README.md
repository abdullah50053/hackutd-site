# HackUTD Organization Site

Code for the website that keeps track of all past HackUTD-organized events
and related organization history.

## Development
Prerequisites:
- NPM

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to install default starter
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
=======
This project uses Tailwind CSS for most of its styles.

### Aside: Data Loading Caveat
If the local dev server is being run while changes to the data directory are
made, the dev server must be restarted to build generated page content such
as officer descriptions or event information.

A fix for this is in the works.
